Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the process of building step by step computer sollutions for real life problems. it aids in making life easier through creating good customer experience, fast healthcare services, automated payments and detection of malpractices such as fraud to prevent loss of properties.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. the software crisis where it became clear that software development was growing at a fast rate for general developers to keep up thus creating software engineering as a distinct discipline.
2. the emmergence of structured software engineering where it emphasized on code readability, code maintenance and correctness.
3. agile manifesto where there was emphasis on flexibility, adaptability and the need for collaboration.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1. planning and requirement analysis: this is defination of project goals, target audience and scope.
2. design: this is where a blueprint of the software is created. it guides on how to solve the problem analyzed.
3. development: this is where the actual coding of the software is done.
4. testing: this is where different methods are used to test the defects and effectiveness of the created software.
5. deployment: this is where the tested software is released to the end users.
6. maintenance: this is where continued support and bug fixes are done
7. Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
the waterfall method involves sequencial or phased process where one phase should end before heading to the next while in agile method, theproject is broken down in to tasks which are done and  tested as the project continues.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
software engineer: designs, develops, tests and maintains software.
quality assurance: checks the quality of the software and oversees the testing process.
project manager:   oversees the entire software development process. this is a brief overview of the roles of the three individuals.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDES  help a programmer have the right tools during the software development process. this include, code editors, compilers and debugging tools while version control systems keep a history of the source code of each software which helps in tracking progress and collaborate in different projects. examples are git.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
maintaining code quality..
meeting tight deadlines.
debugging and trouble shooting
balancing work and life.
strategies to overcome: time management an prioritization of tasks.
continious learning 
staying updated onn the latest trends in the softwares field.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing: this focusses on specific unit in the software at a time.
intergration: this aims at testing the intergration of the different components in computer modules.
system testing involves verifying the whole intergrated system to test its viability and usability.
acceptance testing: this is testing if the system meets the requirements and is acceptable for use by the end user.
the importance of this testing process is to ensure the software is suitable as a sollution for a certain real life problem.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
this is the use of clear, specific and contextual quiries to a gpt model to get accurate and helpful answers for any questions. it is giving the model instructions  on how to give answers or condut tasks. 

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
how to cook ugali: the vague prompt
give n a step to step guide on how to cook ugali. suggest any accompaniments. : proper prompt. 
the importance of the proper prompt is to guide the model on giving a a detailed and clear guide on how to accomplish the task of cooking ugali.
